This plugin is an add-on for WPML (WordPress Multilingual Plugin). It detects the browser language of your user and shows a popup if his browser language is different from the default language of your website. There your user can change the language. Once the user selects a language, the information is stored in a cookie. When he visits the startpage again, he automatically gets redirected to the language he selected.



== Description ==

== Smart display behavior with browser language detection  ==
This plugin detects the browser language of your user. The pop-up only appears, if the user's browser language is different from the default language of your website.

== SEO friendly ==
We will only redirect the user after he has chosen a language in the popup. So there is no automatic redirection without user interaction. As it is unclear, how this would affect your SEO.


== Stores user selection in a cookie ==
Once the user selects a language, the information is stored in a cookie. This cookie is used to redirect the user to his preferred language.


== Redirects user the next time he visits your website ==
When he visits the startpage again, he automatically gets redirected to the language he selected the last time.
